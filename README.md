This Theme is customized based on [Apollo](https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo).

### Demo

This is my [blog](http://www.allenfrostline.com).

### Features

The main focus of the theme, compared with its predecessor, Apollo, is trying to be **more**:

- Simple in layout
- Consistent in colors and comments systems (e.g. gitment & gitalk, which Apollo didn't have)
- Academic in fonts

### Configuration

For theme configuration, please go to Apollo's readme file, where most settings here are inherited from.

### License
