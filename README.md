# Nella

<img width="100%" src="/sourse/screenshot/head.png">

This Theme is customized based on [Apollo](https://github.com/pinggod/hexo-theme-apollo).

## Demo

This is my [blog](http://www.allenfrostline.com).

## Features

The main focus of the theme, compared with its predecessor, Apollo, is trying to be **more**:

- Simple in layout
- Consistent in colors and comments systems (e.g. gitment & gitalk, which Apollo didn't have)
- Academic in fonts

In general, the theme supports features including but not limited to:

- Local search
- Customizable independent pages: About, Tags, Categories, etc.
- Mathjax ($\LaTeX$) and Flowcharts
- Background music
- RSS

## Configuration

For theme configuration, please go to Apollo's readme file, from which inherited most settings of Nella.
